java implementation of knight's tour

<p> In this project, the knight starts off at a position on a chessboard, and has 64 turns to move to each box on the board without repeating the steps.
  There are several billion solutions to the problem, of which about 122,000,000 have the knight finishing on the same square on which it begins. When this occurs the tour is said to be closed.
